This is the same event as Add Camera Zoom without
the stupid line of code that prevents it from zooming at higher zooms
Seriously why the fuck does it do that

Used on MILF on that one "hard" part
Value 1: Camera zoom add (Default: 0.015)
Value 2: UI zoom add (Default: 0.03)
Leave the values blank if you want to use Default.
